## Welcome to Suragch.net

Suragch is a Flutter and Dart developer with a background in Android and iOS.

Although I'm somewhat choosy about the freelance projects I work on, if you have an interesting project I'm open to looking at it, especially if it involves Flutter or Dart. You can find samples of my work on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3681880/suragch) and [GitHub](https://github.com/suragch).
